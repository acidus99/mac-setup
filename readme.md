# Billy's New Clean Install Mac Setup Guide

This is a checklist for me. Your mileage may vary. I usually just upgrade to new OSes in place


## Clean Install on Existing Mac

	- Go into Time Machine and verify that you can see older files.

- Check programs like Textmate. Do you have any *untitled.txt* documents that need to be saved?

#### Place to look for Files
